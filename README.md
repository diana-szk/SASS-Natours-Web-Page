### Benefits Section

- when the image it's hovered, it appears an outline effect and the image it's scaling-up, the other images scaling-down in the same time.

### Tour Section

- a grid with 4 boxes, each one scaling-up when we're hovering over it.

### Price Section

- one of the most interesting component of this page is this card layout, two div elements, one with a front side, with details about the tours, and one with a back side, where is the price, styled to be one on top of each other.  
- another nice effect is happenig when the button "Book now" it's clicked, it appears a popup with more details about the tours.

### Stories Section

- a place where we find some review experiences from the people who already have been in tours. A nice feature in here is how the text it's wrapping up the image, and the background video.

### Booking Section

## Responsive

- some elements are changed, like the cards. Because we can't hover on a phone, or a tablet, the back-side of the card it's now placed on the bottom of front-side

- the images are responsive, set with art direction and resolution switching
